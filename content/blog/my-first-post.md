# This is my first post

Hi everyone.

Today I would like to share my thoughts about my understanding of HR role in a company.

I'm a software engineer and during my almost 10 year career have worked in multiple companies mostly.
I always struggled to understand why company need the HR role at all.


Honestly, people, especially ones that are not from HR departments. How many of you knows what HR role is about? 
First things that comes to mind when you hear HR:
* recruiting - if we are talking about technical roles - usually not very effective
* Surveys about hapiness
* Performance reviews, strange bonus systems
* one on one (support for unhappy employees)


in company there are two types of employees. 

Headlines:
# We all are enterpreneurs!
# Are you working in a company or a startup?
# What the hell startup is?

# intro
...
During last year I spend a lot of time doing interviews. I found out that people have a very broad understanding of what is the difference between startup and a company. 
I also heard a lot of arguments like: 
"I want to work in startup because of the better culture." 
or 
"I don't want to work in a start up because it's unstable." etc...
In this article I will describe how those terms are connected and how to get value from understanding those terms better.
...

# Definitions of what startup is not
 observations what people think startup is

"Startup is a culture"
"Startup is working 20 hours perd day in a garage"
"Startup is risk and you can lose your job every day"
"Startup is fun"
"Startup is huge and continious growth"
"Startup is while you have less than 100 employees and less then 10M gross revenue"

This is the shortlist of answers I get on a question "what does startup mean for you?"
While all of this could be the truth I doesn't feel good about those definitions.


# Definitions of companies
 observations what people think company is

 "Company is stable"
 "Company is enterprise"
 "Company is bureacracy"
 "Company is boring"
 "A company is a legal entity formed by a group of individuals to engage in and operate a business"

# Where is the truth?
 what is common and what is different - only the goal is different
# lean as a transformation tool
 how lean thinking helps us to get from startup to company
# startups in our life 
 where else do we have startups

Long story short:

Startup is the inception of the company. At this point you have and idea and at least one follower of that idea - you.
Every startup goal is to survive. To survive you have to find your business model.
To find business model means not just to figure out one, but to actually have clients who are ready to participate in that model. As soon as you did it - you have a company.



According businessdictionary.com
"Business is an organization or economic system where goods and services are exchanged for one another or for money"

# Startup is the inception of the company

Startup is not a company, not an idea, not a culture and not a team sitting in a garage and working 20 hours per day - it's a period of time in a company/product/feature lifecycle.

This moment is very special 

For startup to exist there should be only two components, "the idea" and at least on follower.
If you have an idea and you believe in it, my congratulations! You have a startup.



Startup goal
Everybody 
Funny, during my 10 year career I have worked in a companies, enterprises, startups, companies-startups, startup companies


startup vs business 
 * definition of startup
 * definition of startuo goal
 * How business is born
 * goal of the business - idealogical - to please customer - real one to make profit
 ** you are no able to please customer if you don't have profit
 ** like in emergency - first you need to help yourself and then others
 ** sometimes you need money in advance to help yourself to please customers
 * Business grows and different roles and their responsibilities growth also 
 * Challenges to face and to accept/ Decisions to make
 ** From everyone fullfiling all the roles - to dedicated people
 ** Growing rapidly or slowly
 * Focus on effectiveness not on defensiveness
